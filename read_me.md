Problem Statement: 
In a college or university, it's common to have a hostel or dormitory where students live during their academic years. Managing the accommodation for a large number of students efficiently can be challenging. The Hostel Accommodation Management System is designed to address this problem by providing a software solution to manage student accommodations within a college hostel. Hereâ€™s the description of the problem it solves:
Student Allocation
Tracking Available Accommodations
Student Removal
Displaying Student Details
User Interface

Explanation:
The Hostel Accommodation Management System is designed to manage student accommodations efficiently. It allows students to be added, allocating beds to them, and later removing students from their allocated beds if necessary. The system distinguishes between undergraduate and postgraduate students, keeping track of their names, roll numbers, branches, and the number of beds they have been assigned. The system also manages room allocation, attempting to group students from the same branch into the same room when possible, while ensuring that each room does not exceed its maximum capacity. The interactive interface is accessible to hostel administrators and provides features for displaying student details and checking the availability of beds. In addition, the system enforces data integrity to prevent the allocation of beds to students with invalid information. Overall, it simplifies the management of hostel accommodations, ensuring efficient allocation and tracking of resources.

The Hostel Accommodation Management System provides a software solution for managing student accommodations efficiently. It includes the following components:
Student Class: Represents a student with attributes such as name and branch. It also provides a method to display student information.
Room Class: Represents a room in the hostel with attributes for the room number and an array of students (beds). It provides methods for adding and removing students, checking if it's full, and retrieving student information.
Hostel Class: This is the core component of the system. It manages a list of rooms, keeps track of allocated students, and provides methods for allocating students to rooms, removing students, checking available beds, and displaying student details. It also ensures that students of the same branch are allocated to the same room.
